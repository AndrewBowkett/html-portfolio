        <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am a hard-working, responsible, and organised individual. I can adapt off different
            situations well using my own initiative.<br/>
            Additionally, I play Hockey for Worcester Hockey Club, this highlights my ability to
            work within a team and communicate well with others.<br/>
            Furthermore, I have completed various DIY projects around the home and within the
            garden, this shows I can work well on my own and I always complete the task set in
            front of me by having good time management skills.<br/>
            I also have experience in working in a fast-paced environment where customer
            experience is the main priority. This shows I can manage my workload effectively and
            efficiently.<br/>
            I have basic knowledge in the network industry such as cabling, routers, and switches
            due to home usage, but I am eager to expand this knowledge to build bigger and
            better networks with new technologies.<br/>
            One of my main goals is to move into project management and co-ordinate a team as
            I am a logical person and can find solutions to problems quickly, providing a high level
            of quality.<br/>
